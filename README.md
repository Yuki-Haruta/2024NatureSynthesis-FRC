## Description
FRC stands for Flux-Regulated Crystallization

This repository includes data and codes related to a paper which will be published in Nature Synthesis.

It includes four folders: "Data", "Plot-codes", "Figures", and "for-Crystal Growth"

## Data and codes for plotting
In "Plot-codes", you can find scripts to make figures which are shown in the manuscript.

These codes refer to the data stored in "Data"

The saved figures are stored in "Figures"

## for Crystal Growth
This provides the Python script to run flux-regulated crystallization.

The codes are optimized for our use in Saidaminov Lab but are available for anyone after some modification.
